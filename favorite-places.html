    <h1>My favorite places</h1>
    <h2>Here are a few of my favorite places</h2>

    <h3>The coast</h3>
    <p>The coast is the <em>best</em> place to get away for a day or two</p>

    <h3>The woods</h3>

    <p>I like to escape to the forest when I need time to collect my thoughts</p>

    <h3>Flower fields</h3>
    <p>Basically any place surrounded by flowers is a place I like to go to relieve stress</p>
